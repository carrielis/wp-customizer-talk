# Building Themes with the WP Customizer API
## By Dave Green

If you’re not already using the customizer to add custom ‘options’ into your themes, then this talk will help you get started! I will cover the fundamentals of getting your theme ready for customizer action before showing you how to add settings, controls, sections and panels. Then the talk will touch on more advanced topics such as enabling live updates to preview your changes, exercising control over your website’s colours and finally how to add your own custom controls for more advanced input options.
